# virtual_store_navigation

🛒 Virtual Store Navigation
An interactive Unity-based virtual store experience that allows users to explore products and interact with 3D models inside a virtual environment.
This project focuses on navigation, interaction design, and user experience. Checkout and backend functionality are intentionally kept as concept-level features for future enhancement.

🧰 Technologies
Unity (3D environment & interactions)
C# (scripting and logic)
3D product models
Audio integration for interaction feedback
Basic frontend UI (demo purpose)

✨ Features
Here’s what users can do:
Navigate through a Unity-based virtual store layout
Interact with 3D product models (rotate on touch/click)
Listen to audio-based product descriptions
Clickable UI buttons like Add to Cart and Proceed to Pay (demo only)
Experience audio feedback such as payment success (simulation)
View simple frontend pages for sign-up (trial/demo integration)

🔄 The Process
I started by creating the virtual store environment in Unity and placing interactive 3D product models.
Using C# scripts, I enabled rotation and interaction when the models are touched or clicked.
Audio cues were added to explain product details and simulate user actions.
Basic frontend UI pages were merged only for demonstration, to represent how a real shopping flow could look in the future.
The main focus was to keep the system simple, interactive, and idea-driven.

📚 What I Learned
Creating interactive 3D environments using Unity
Handling user interactions with C# scripting
Designing navigation and flow inside virtual spaces
Presenting concept-based features clearly and honestly

🚀 Future Improvements
Functional cart and checkout system
Backend integration for real transactions
Mini-map for navigation
More immersive UI and animations
